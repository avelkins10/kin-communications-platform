## üéØ Your Mission: 3 Steps to Test

### Step 1: Update .env (2 minutes)

Open `.env` and update these three values:

```bash
# 1. Your Twilio phone number (from Twilio Console)
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX

# 2. Your mobile/work number (where calls should forward)
DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX

# 3. For local testing, start ngrok first (see Step 2)
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io
```

### Step 2: Start ngrok (1 minute)

```bash
# In a new terminal window
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the `https://` URL and paste it as `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env`

### Step 3: Start the App (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install and start
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Configure Twilio (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/active
2. Click your phone number
3. Scroll to "Voice Configuration"
4. Set **"A CALL COMES IN"** to:
   - Webhook
   - `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/voice`
   - HTTP POST

5. Scroll down to "Status Callback URL":
   - `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/status`
   - HTTP POST

6. Click **Save**

### Step 5: Test! (5 minutes)

```bash
# Call your Twilio number from any phone
# You should hear: "Please hold while we connect you..."
# Call forwards to your DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_NUMBER
# Call is recorded (dual-channel)
```

**Then check:**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Go to Dashboard ‚Üí History
3. See your call in the list
4. Click Play to hear the recording

## üéâ Success Criteria

‚úÖ You hear greeting when you call
‚úÖ Call forwards to your number
‚úÖ Call appears in dashboard
‚úÖ Recording plays back

## üêõ If Something's Wrong

### "Webhook not receiving calls"
```bash
# Check ngrok is running
open http://localhost:4040
# You should see traffic when you call
```

### "Call doesn't forward"
```bash
# Check DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_NUMBER is correct
grep DEFAULT_EMPLOYEE_NUMBER .env

# Check app is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### "No recording"
```bash
# Check webhook URL is configured in Twilio Console
# Make sure you saved after updating
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (After Testing)

### Phase 2: Customer Routing (Optional)

Connect QuickBase to route calls to assigned project coordinators:

```bash
# Update .env
QUICKBASE_REALM_HOST=yourcompany.quickbase.com
QUICKBASE_USER_TOKEN=your-token
QUICKBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

Then incoming calls will:
1. Look up caller in QuickBase
2. Find their project coordinator
3. Route to coordinator's number

### Phase 3: SMS (Optional)

Configure SMS webhook in Twilio Console:
- `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/twilio/sms`
